h1. Alpha Channel

Spooner's entry for Ludum Dare 18 - "Enemies as weapons"

This is my first LD. This game is quite simple, but has some concepts it may take a couple of games to understand.
By taking control of your enemies, you can block and kill the other enemies that are nearly as tough as you are.
Unfortunately, while controlling an enemy, the other enemies will continue to attack you so you need to protect yourself
AND make sure you don't run out of energy, freeing your slave! Sometimes running away for a bit is the best plan...

Best, though, is play and figure it out for yourself! Press F1 for in-game help.
