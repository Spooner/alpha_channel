            * You are the Blue pixel.

            * Take control of other pixels, and use them
              to protect yourself!

            * Controlling is very strenuous and will use
              up your limited energy reserves (Blueness).

            * Pixels always hurt pixels that aren't the
              same colour. When controlling, you taint the
              other pixel's colour, so you can use it as a
              weapon against its former comrades!

            * As pixels become weaker, they become more
              transparent.

            It is hell being a pixel. Why can't they all
            just get along?

            You are the last of the mystic Blue pixels,
            with the power to control the other colours.

            Red desires nothing but to purge the screen
            of all Blue!

            Green is too busy musing on the nature of the
            Great Electron Gun to give you much notice.

            Yellow is the first of five fearful bosses,
            found on screen #4. Cyan, Magenta, Black and
            White will follow after each four screens.
