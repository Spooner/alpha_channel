It is hell being a pixel. Why can't they all just get along?


<b><c=88bb88>= How to play =</c></b>

  * <c=ff0000>Red</c> is evil; <c=ff0000>Red</c> wants to hurt <c=6666ff>Blue</c>!
    <c=ffff00>Yellow</c> is <i>so</i> nasty, it makes <c=ff0000>Red</c> look nice by comparison!
    Thankfully, <c=00ff00>Green</c> is too busy thinking to even notice <c=4444ff>Blue</c>.

  * Take control of other pixels, and use them to protect yourself!

  * Controlling is very strenuous and will use up your limited
    energy reserves (<c=6666ff>Blueness</c>).

  * Pixels hurt pixels that aren't the same colour.
    It has always been like that, but no-one knows exactly why...
    <c=ffff00>Yellow</c> is so dangerous, that even <c=ff0000>Red</c> avoids it, but <c=00ff00>Green</c> is more
    interested in musing on the nature of the Great Electron Gun.
